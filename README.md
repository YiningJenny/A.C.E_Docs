__Han Hsun Shih(Amy)__: Art assets.

__Collaborative completion__: Multiple testing, physical environment setup, and small-scale player experience exhibition.

__Inheritance from the previous term__: Inspiration from the Tower of Babel, improving signal transmission efficiency between Arduino and Unity, changes in code structure.

## In the future
- __Add more levels:__ for example, recognize people's movements with dynamic video, and take the viewer to write words with strokes.
- __Adjust the force size:__ The current one is too small, so the game is too difficult for the audience.
- __Adjust the image resource of the center tip:__ The size of the center needs to be the same as the size of the force. Help the audience better Orient themselves. We need to attach a sensor behind the curtain and shoot it with darts. There is a risk that the curtain will be damaged, so we can't use a normal projector.
- __Wireless:__ Replace the sensors that are currently wired with Bluetooth sensors.
